### Internship-System
  This project is a front-end prototype of a web-based internship management system developed as part of a university software engineering course. It is designed to support key workflows between students, companies, faculty members, and the SCAD office, including internship applications, evaluations, report submissions, and status tracking.
  
  The project began with a requirements engineering phase, where a complete set of 50 functional and 7 non-functional requirements was defined to ensure clarity, usability, and scalability. These requirements guided the design and development of the user interface.
  
  The front-end was implemented using React, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, with a focus on intuitive user experience, consistent UI design, and responsive layout. The system uses dummy data to simulate backend functionality and demonstrate core features.
